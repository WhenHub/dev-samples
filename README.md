A collection of examples of how to use the WhenHub API.

For most of the examples, you will need to get an Access Token from your [WhenHub Studio Profile page](https://studio.whenhub.com/account). More help on getting your Access Token can be found [here](https://developer.whenhub.com/docs/api).

Run `npm install` in  /display/jquerySample folder  
Run `npm start`
